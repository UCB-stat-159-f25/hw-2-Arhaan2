# HW 2 — From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data are based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial).  
This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley’s Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/).  
Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._



## Contents
- `LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb` – main analysis notebook (with attribution above)  
- `ligotools/` – Python package containing `readligo.py` utilities  
- `data/` – subset of GW150914 event data files  
- `environment.yml` – reproducible Conda environment (name = `ligo`)  
- `ai_documentation.txt` – record of any AI/LLM use  
- `.gitignore` – standard exclusions  



## Run on Binder
